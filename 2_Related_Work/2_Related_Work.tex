\startglyph In this chapter we attempt to briefly characterize the history of NLG, with a focus
on text summarization as well as the development nueral NLG models since
these topics are central to the contributions of this thesis. While many
bibliographies of the field might start their history of NLG 
with the beginning
of modern computer hardware (i.e., after the development of silicon transistors and the growth of mainframe computing
in the 1950s), we briefly highlight instances of algorithmic language 
generation starting in the middle ages through the early modern period,
and how they connect to notable figures in the broader history of computation.
We proceed chronologically, starting in antiquity, and then moving to the formulation of modern NLG in the period between 1980 and 2000. We then discuss 
the growth of data-driven method for text summarization between 2000 and 2014.
We conclude with a description of the neural network, a.k.a. deep learning,
revolution that arguably began in 2014, and which has had a signifcant 
impact on NLP, but especially NLG.
