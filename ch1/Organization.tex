\section{Organization}

This thesis is organized as follows. \autoref{ch:relwork} gives a brief history
of the field of NLG and as well as related work in text-to-text generation and
summarization. \autoref{ch:dlsum} and \autoref{ch:mlsum} focus on various
salience estimation and content selection problems for text summarization with
a focus single document summarization and stream summarization respectvely. In
\autoref{ch:nlg}, we then discuss our proposed methods for faithful and
controllable neural NLG models.  Finally, limitations, future work, and
concluding thoughts are presented in \autoref{ch:conclusion}.  While each
chapter is working towards the larger narrative and themes of this thesis, they
can be read in a self contained manner. To that end, Notational conventions are
specific to each chapter and are introduced on a per chapter basis.
