\subsection{Redundancy Filtering and Update Selection}
\label{sec:upsel}

The exemplar sentences from the exemplar selection stage are the most salient
and representative of the input for the current hour. However, we need to
reconcile these sentences with updates from the previous hours to ensure that
the most salient and least redundant  updates are selected. To ensure that
only the most salient updates are selected we apply a minimum salience
threshold; after exemplar sentences have been identified, any exemplars whose
salience is less than $\lambda_{sal}$ are removed from consideration. 

Next, to prevent adding updates that are redundant with previous output
updates, we filter out exemplars that are too similar to previous updates.
The exemplars are examined sequentially in order of decreasing salience and  a
similarity threshold is applied, where the exemplar is ignored if its maximum
semantic similarity to any previous updates in the summary is greater than
$\lambda_{sim}$.  Exemplars that pass these thresholds (indicated as
$\updateSummary_t$ in \hyperref[alg:clustsum]{Alg. \ref{alg:clustsum} line
\ref{alg:filter}}) are selected as updates and added to the summary.
