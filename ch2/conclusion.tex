\section{Conclusion}
We have presented an empirical study of deep learning based salience 
estimation
algorithms for summarization. Our findings suggest such models face stark limitations in their ability to learn robust features for this task and that 
more work is needed on sentence representation for summarization.
In the next chapter, we explore feature based models of sentence 
representation that allow us to capture domain specific intuitions 
of salience
for a streaming summarization problem. Additionally, we develop more wholistic 
summarization algorithms that can incorporate  salience estimates (which
could be produced  either
by a \deeplearning~or classical \machinelearning~based salience estimator)
while taking into account features of redundancy or novelty.
